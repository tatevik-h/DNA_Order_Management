# DNA_Order_Management

This project involves building a backend system for an eCommerce website that serves a synthetic DNA and DNA products manufacturing company. The company produces synthetic DNA and provides DNA synthesis services for customers in various industries. Customers can place orders for synthetic DNA through the eCommerce website, and the company will initiate the synthesis process, completing it and then shipping the product to the customer.

In addition to synthetic DNA services, the company also sells products that aid in manufacturing medicines, which customers can also order through the eCommerce website.
